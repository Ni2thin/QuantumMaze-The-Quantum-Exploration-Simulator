# QuantumMaze-The-Quantum-Exploration-Simulator
QuantumMaze is an interactive web-based simulation designed to visualize key quantum mechanics phenomena like superposition, entanglement, and quantum tunneling. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project creates a dynamic environment where particles move within a maze, bouncing off walls and interacting in quantum-inspired ways.
