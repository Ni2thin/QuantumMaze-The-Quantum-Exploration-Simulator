# QuantumMaze: The Quantum Exploration Simulator

QuantumMaze is an interactive simulation that visualizes key quantum mechanics concepts using particles and maze-like environments. Explore phenomena like superposition, entanglement, and quantum tunneling with an engaging, web-based interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features:
- **Wave/Particle Toggle**: Switch between visualizing particles as point-like objects or waveforms to represent wave-particle duality.
- **Entanglement**: Randomly entangle particles, connecting them with visual lines to showcase quantum entanglement.
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Observe particles randomly "tunnel" through walls, a nod to the quantum phenomenon.
- **Maze Walls**: Particles interact with maze walls, bouncing off them to mimic real-world behaviors.
- **Particle Count Control**: Adjust the number of particles to increase or decrease the simulation's complexity.
- **Pause/Play**: Control the animation of particles.
- **Background Music**: A relaxing background music option that enhances the immersive experience.
- **Save State**: Download the current simulation state as an image for later use.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Particle logic, maze interaction, and simulation dynamics.
